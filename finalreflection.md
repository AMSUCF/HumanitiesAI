## Final Reflection

Throughout this semester, we've explored the impact of generative AI through textual, visual, and procedural output, iterating through towards multimodal generation. Several of the usages we've encountered are still in early stages, and there's both significant speculation and hype around the futures these tools portend. This final reflection is an opportunity to think about that future work: in a discussion post of 500-750 words, contextualize the work you've produced and critiqued this semester. Your reflection should be guided by the following questions, which ask you to connect your past, present, and future work with generative AI:

- **What past perceptions did this course challenge - or confirm?** Does generative AI work the way you expected? Have your expectations of these tools (or of how you see yourself working with them) changed from where you started?
- **What present work are you most excited about?** Did you start anything you want to continue? Did any particular exercise resonate with your goals, or raise questions or concerns that you want to address further?
- **What will you take with you to your future work?** How will you speak to colleagues and/or students about generative AI going forward?

These questions are deliberately broad, and not all of them necessariy apply to you. Feel free to select and adapt. Your response can include generative AI materials if you prefer, though this is entirely optional. Replies to other students' reflections are not required but encouraged as we wrap up our semester together.
