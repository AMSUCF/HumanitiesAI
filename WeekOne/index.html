        <h3>About Future ELIZA</h3>
        <p>This is a demonstration chatbot that simulates how ELIZA might respond if it were an AI from the future (circa 2045). Created using Claude Sonnet 4, this version employs more sophisticated responses while maintaining the conversational therapy style. It's designed to explore themes of AI advancement, technological optimism, and future speculation‚Äîparticularly as they relate to humanities education and human concerns.</p>
        <p>Future ELIZA recognizes a wide range of topics relevant to humanities students and human experience, including reading, writing, creativity, authorship, education, programming, labor, copyright, art, expression, dreams, economy, and love. It speculates about how AI might transform these fields while maintaining an optimistic view of human-AI collaboration and human flourishing.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a simple demonstration bot with pre-programmed responses, not actual AI from the future!</p>
