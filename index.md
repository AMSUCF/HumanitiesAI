## Course Description

This course offers an exploration of the theory and practice of
artificial intelligence and its use in textual, visual, and procedural
arts and humanities work. The course is divided into three units,
reflecting these primary areas of the usage of AI, and engaging with
both creative examples and theoretical critiques of that usage:

-   **Textual.** In the textual unit, we will consider the history of
    textual generation and analysis, with attention to both the
    exploitation of and applications for archives, literature, and
    historical work. Students will engage in textual generation and textual analysis.
-   **Visual.** In the visual unit, we will explore visual generation
    and its challenges for authorship and meaning, with attention to
    parallel discussions in modern and postmodern media. Students will
    engage in generation for both visual material and for image-texts
    and consider the changing perspectives on artists and creativity.
-   **Procedural.** In the procedural unit, we will dive into the layer
    of code, with attention to the history of generative practices in
    both electronic literature and digital humanities usage. Students
    will co-author code and interactive projects with AI models,
    focusing on use cases for libraries, archives, museums, and artistic
    expression.

The final weeks will focus on combinatorial practices of
textual-visual-procedural generation that bring these methods together
with human imagination towards arts and humanities problems. Each week,
plan on following the module for all asynchronous activities. Each
module will be divided into three sections:

-   **Weekly Readings.** Complete this combination of primary and
    secondary texts prior to starting the making exercise. The full
    schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus: additional
    recommended readings will be provided in each module.
-   **Generative Exercises.** Each week's generative exercise will
    involve experimenting with and reflecting upon generative AI tools in different contexts. Most will use the required Anthropic subscription, but some other free tools or trials will be recommended throughout.
-   **Reflective Discussion.** A weekly online discussion will provide
    the opportunity to share the process of each exercise: the emphasis is not
    on "success" or "failure," but on critiquing the process and
    products through a theoretical lens.

## Course Objectives

-   Engage in both critical and creative projects exploring the pitfalls
    and potentials of large language models in visual, textual, and
    procedural work
-   Understand the history and implications of computer-augmentation
    across the arts and humanities
-   Make connections between contemporary policies around AI and past
    debates and perspectives on other technologies
-   Use large datasets to solve problems in the arts and humanities,
    with attention to evaluating and critiquing these methods alongside
    more traditional approaches in these disciplines
-   Use and analyze the application of AI generative methods for
    textual, visual, and procedural work.
-   Critique policies and uses of AI in various communities and contexts
    (the workplace, academia, etc.)

## Materials and Texts

This course requires a mix of applied and theoretical readings,
including some open access materials. The primary texts include:

-   Melanie Mitchell. *Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans* (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2019). (Physical copy on reserve in the UCF Library)
-   Safiya Noble. *Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism.* (NYU Press, 2018). [Unlimited Access Ebook via UCF Library](https://go.openathens.net/redirector/ucf.edu?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.2307%2Fj.ctt1pwt9w5)
-   Michael L. Littman. *Code to Joy: Why Everyone Should Learn a Little Programming* (MIT Press, 2023). [Unlimited Access Ebook via UCF Library](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucf/detail.action?docID=30319504)
-   Emily Bender and Alex Hanna. *The AI Con: How to Fight Big Tech's Hype and Create the Future We Want* (Beacon Press, 2024).

In addition, each module includes samples, tutorials, and resources to
guide the week's making experiments. Relevant recent articles will be integrated regularly to encourage awareness of the current discourse and the field.

## Required Subscriptions

Students will need to subscribe to [Anthropic's Claude](https://claude.ai/) for hands-on exercises throughout the semester. A paid subscription is required to access the full functionality needed for course assignments.

## Evaluation and Grading

| Points | Assignment Summary                                                                                                      | Due Date    |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 6      | **Activity Verification** - Complete the brief survey posted on Webcourses as soon as possible to confirm your enrollment in the course. As this is required by the university, please attend to it as soon as possible at the start of classes. | Friday, August 22nd |
| 84    | **Generative Exercises** - Weekly discussions will consist of making, sharing, and reflecting on the process of exploring. We will work from tutorials and try a new form every week, with reflective questions connecting our process of making to the theoretical frameworks and provocations offered by our readings (14 exercises, 6 points each) | Weekly |
| 10     | **Reflection** - During the final exam week, students will complete a reflective essay on their journey, with particular consideration to next steps and potential future applications of the making mechanisms introduced throughout the semester. This reflection should include AI-generated material alongside materials produced directly by the student. | Saturday, December 6th |


Students can access their grades and feedback at any time using the
Grade Book function of Webcourses. All assignments will be submitted
through Webcourses. Plan on checking the site at least twice a week for
updates and assignment information. Grades are calculated out of 100
following a standard letter scale.

Late work is accepted without penalty for one week after the listed
deadline. If circumstances require extension beyond that deadline,
please reach out to the instructor immediately.

There is one extra credit making exercise option available at the end of
the semester for those who miss a weeek. Grades will be available
through Webcourses and updated weekly.

## Asynchronous Online Course Structure

This course uses a fully asynchronous online format, and relies upon
students to complete all readings, engage with both course lectures and
other online videos, and join in on course discussions. All assignments
are due at the close of their listed module, but will be accepted with
no penalty through the next listed deadline. Once an assignment closes,
late work will not be accepted unless an additional extension has
already been approved by the instructor: please reach out early if
circumstances will require additional time!

-   The course has no synchronous meeting requirements: however,
    students are encouraged to engage in optional check-in meetings to
    think through their process and growth. Optional synchronous
    meetings will be scheduled based on the poll conducted in the first
    week of class.
-   Office hour assistance is additionally available both through text
    on Webcourses messages and via Zoom: Zoom is recommended for
    advanced technical problems, where screen-sharing might be helpful
    to resolving errors.
-   Students will need access to a reliable internet connection and
    computer to participate in this course. Due to some of the AI tool
    installation needs, administrative access to the system is required
    to complete assignments.
-   In the event of an emergency or medical challenge, additional
    flexibility beyond the grading guidelines is available: when
    anticipated, students should reach out to the instructor as soon as
    feasible to form a plan or discuss an incomplete if needed.
